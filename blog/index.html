				post.Title == Website Launched! <br /><br /><br />
				As of Thursday February 13th , I feel as though this website is finally
				in a spot where I would consider it launched, While it has been public
				for a while it now has actual content in it. Hooray! <br /><br />
				Its just less than a month until the semester starts up and I plan on
				hosting any projects made for classes on my github and subsequently on
				the projects section, think of this as a mix between a portfolio website
				and a blog. Future blog posts will likely be far and few between. Most
				likely they will come along-side major project updates/releases.
				Explaining the projects and the work that has gone in to them.
